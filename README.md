# Summer, a 2D game engine made in swift

This isn't being developed anymore.
This was a bit of a successor to [SEEngine](https://github.com/1whatleytay/SEEngine) with lots of the same classes but in Apple's Metal API!
I thought Metal was super easy to use!
I'm really a big fan of it.

I didn't end up using this for many projects, I made a map editor and stuff.
But this never really took of, I think the code quality is much better than SEEngine if anything.
This is timestamped early grade 9 :)
